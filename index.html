        <p>The three friends usually sit in the same spots for Astronomy 3: &quot;Nature of Universe&quot; &ndash; five rows down from the back of the lecture hall, three seats on the far right.</p>

        <p>The row is far enough from the front of the classroom for anyone sitting there to avoid notice, but the three stand out. Sitting upright in their chairs, the three gray-haired gentlemen have no backpacks, no textbooks and no laptops.</p>

        <p>In the midst of keyboard staccatos, Michael Stern, 76 years old, steadily scratches down a note or two on his yellow, lined paper.</p>

        <p>Seated next to him, Harold &ldquo;Rusty&rdquo; Rosenblatt, 71 years old, gazes at the PowerPoint slides through his silver-rimmed glasses, which sit snugly on the edge of his nose. Meanwhile, 75-year-old Steve Loeb &ndash; tall and dapper, his hair combed to the side and polo shirt neatly tucked in his khaki shorts &ndash; peers over at Stern&rsquo;s notes.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Nature of Universe&rdquo; is just one of more than 40 classes that the three friends have taken together through the Senior Scholars Program, which allows seniors to audit undergraduate classes at UCLA every quarter.</p>

        <p>Loeb, Rosenblatt and Stern have been listening to UCLA lectures together for about five years.</p>

        <p>The program, run by the the UCLA Longevity Center, aims to help people 50 and older keep their cognitive functions sharp through active learning.</p>

        <p>Loeb, a former pharmacist who attended UCLA for a quarter before transferring to UC Berkeley, and Rosenblatt, a former attorney, have taken classes with Stern, a UCLA alumnus and former pharmacist, to satisfy their intellectual craving for a liberal arts education.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a certain satisfaction when it comes to learning,&rdquo; Loeb said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s intellectually stimulating that we&rsquo;re fulfilling a part of our lives that we&rsquo;ve waited until now to do.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Liberal arts classes used to be luxuries that they couldn&rsquo;t afford to indulge in because of degree requirements, job searching, marriage and the Vietnam War.</p>

        <p>Now in their 70s, the three friends are picking up where they left off &ndash; one class at a time.</p>



        <p>Loeb, Rosenblatt and Stern have their methods when it comes to picking interesting classes.</p>

    <div class="section" data-anchor="thirdPage">
        <p>It&rsquo;s usually by word of mouth that they come upon intriguing courses. They ask students and fellow senior scholars for recommendations. They also dig through BruinWalk and Rate My Professors &ndash; most UCLA students&rsquo; go-to sites during the class enrollment season.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Oh! And we also Google everybody that we take,&rdquo; Rosenblatt chimed in with his thick New York accent.</p>

        <p>The three friends are among 150 senior scholars who are enrolled in the program this quarter, said Erin Der-McLeod, the Senior Scholars coordinator and administrative specialist at the UCLA Longevity Center. Senior scholars are allowed to take any undergraduate course &ndash; except laboratory, language and studio classes that require daily professor-student interaction &ndash; without having to do the assignments or exams.</p>

        <p>Many of the senior scholars, ranging in age from their 50s to 90s, are retired and take classes through the program because they now have the time and opportunities to delve into their other interests, Der-McLeod said.</p>

        <p>Stern said he came to know about the program through Bob Ross, a fellow senior scholar.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the troublemaker,&rdquo; said Ross, grinning slyly. Ross, the &ldquo;baby&rdquo; of the group &ndash; being 71 years old &ndash; is taking his 52nd class at UCLA this fall.</p>

        <p>Stern enrolled in the Senior Scholars Program in 2011 to take on-campus courses taught by UCLA professors, which he said were more challenging than the classes offered by the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at UCLA, where he first took a jab at learning in a classroom setting again. Osher is a branch of UCLA Extension that offers instructor-led classes, discussions and other programs designed for adults 50 or older at off-campus sites in Westwood, Sherman Oaks and Hollywood.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call Osher &ndash; light FM. It&rsquo;s easy listening,&rdquo; said Ross, who thinks Osher is a great way to meet people but is less rigorous in content. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun but not too tough, so I asked the guys, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take the real deal?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Loeb and Rosenblatt joined the Senior Scholars Program in 2008 and 2011, respectively. Both came to learn about the program through their longtime friends: Loeb through Stern, and Rosenblatt through Ross. Loeb and Stern have known each other since &quot;Abraham Lincoln made a speech at Gettysburg,&quot; according to Rosenblatt.</p>

        <p>&quot;Whenever we get good things in our lives, we share it with each other,&quot; Stern said.</p>

        <p>For the three senior scholars, requirements no longer apply in life. They said they decided to step into a lecture hall again because they genuinely wanted to learn.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;What motivated me was the absolute fun (of) taking a class where I wasn&rsquo;t required to take a test or do anything,&rdquo; Rosenblatt said. &ldquo;In other words, there was no academic stress.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Loeb, Rosenblatt and Stern are not picky learners. So far, they&rsquo;ve taken courses in a variety of fields, such as Jewish studies, communication studies and art history.</p>

        <p>One of Rosenblatt&rsquo;s favorites were a German course about the portrayal of the Holocaust in film and literature. The class included a weekly meetup with Holocaust survivors, a program that was organized by Hillel at UCLA, an on-campus Jewish organization.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It was always an amazing thing for me to walk out of there and realize that all of these people &ndash; you&rsquo;d see them on the street but you wouldn&rsquo;t realize all the trials and tribulations they had to go through early in their life to get to this point,&rdquo; Rosenblatt said.</p>

        <p>In other classes, he said there are moments when he feels he can offer his own take on the issues and events that students are learning about &ndash; such as the Vietnam War &ndash; because he has lived through them.</p>

        <p>But Rosenblatt and his other two friends refrain from talking in lectures or office hours unless the professors ask for their opinions, because the Senior Scholars Program emphasizes that the courses are first and foremost intended for enrolled students.</p>

        <p>Still, the three said they are grateful for the opportunity to learn with UCLA students. Sure, they might be the only ones &ndash; other than the professor &ndash; who understand the jokes from &ldquo;All in the Family,&rdquo; a '70s TV show.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;But learning is what keeps you alive,&rdquo; Stern said.</p>

                    <p>VIGNETTE 1: &ldquo;RUSTY&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>The Vietnam War was &ldquo;hot and heavy&rdquo; when Rosenblatt was attending the University of Akron in Ohio between 1962 and 1966. The war felt uncomfortably close &ndash; almost as if it were happening in the dorm room right next to his, he said.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It was in the newspapers every day. That was (back in) the day when people read newspapers,&rdquo; Rosenblatt said teasingly. &ldquo;It would be in your face all the time.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Men who weren&rsquo;t in college were being drafted, but Rosenblatt said he wanted to finish his college education before joining the war effort. The Selective Service System, an independent federal agency responsible for implementing the military draft, issued deferment to full-time students making satisfactory progress in any academic field during the Vietnam War.</p>

                    <p>Rosenblatt, a business and marketing student, was able to defer military service for four years during college and an additional three years when he decided to attend Brooklyn Law School after graduating from the University of Akron in 1966. Rosenblatt said he thought it would be easier to find a job upon returning from service if he already had his degree.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;You had to carry a full load (of classes to maintain deferment), and you had to focus on getting a degree. Right after you graduated, you were going into the armed forces,&rdquo; Rosenblatt said.</p>

                    <p>Every summer, and in between semesters, he waited tables and delivered beer in New York and Brooklyn to pay for his college tuition. He was able to support himself throughout college and law school without taking out a loan.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Sometimes, you had to shape up,&rdquo; Rosenblatt said. &ldquo;You appear at a union (hiring) hall early in the morning, and you just sit there and hope that someone kicks you to go out to work.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Slouching against the union wall at 7 a.m., Rosenblatt would wait for a day&rsquo;s job to fall in his hands. If he was lucky enough, he would be sent off to work at 2 p.m. and toil away until 1 a.m. He would be back at the wall at 7 a.m. in search of a job for the next day, because union jobs were relatively well-paid during those times, Rosenblatt said.</p>

                    <p>Experimenting with potential interests and passions was not an option because of time, he said. There was the pressure of earning enough to pay for the next semester and completing his degree before being drafted into the army. Also, the courses were prescribed and there weren&rsquo;t many electives that he could take.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the reasons I love the Senior Scholars Program &ndash; because you can experiment with anything you might be interested in,&rdquo; Rosenblatt said.</p>

                    <p>VIGNETTE 2: MICHAEL</p>

                    <p>When Stern is on campus &ndash; meeting, walking to class and eating with UCLA students &ndash; he said he feels like he&rsquo;s an undergraduate student again.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;If you close your eyes, you forget that you&rsquo;re old,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p>It has taken Stern about 40 years since he left UCLA in 1960 to have the time and leisure to learn about topics that he had always wanted to pursue. This year marks his ninth year of taking classes through the Senior Scholars Program.</p>

                    <p>The decision to sit in a lecture hall again, with pen and notepad in hand, came partly from his craving for the humanities &ndash; a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; that Stern said he didn&rsquo;t have the chance to patch up during his undergraduate years at UCLA.</p>

                    <p>Stern said he felt pressured to figure out what he wanted to do after college as quickly as possible. Once he had settled on pharmacy as his field of study, he didn&rsquo;t have the time to explore other potential paths.</p>

                    <p>Although Stern regrets not taking as many humanities classes as he would have liked to in his undergraduate years, he said he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do anything differently if he was back in college. As a former prepharmacy student, Stern recalled he had five hours of lecture and 10 hours of lab per week.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;I felt the pressure (to graduate) because I didn&rsquo;t come from a family that had much money. (College) was still expensive for us,&rdquo; Stern said. &ldquo;I felt pressured to figure out my life, just like kids today.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Stern&rsquo;s parents were both immigrants who had traveled by sea from Europe to the United States to escape World War II. On the boat headed toward their new home, Stern&rsquo;s mother, who had succeeded in escaping Nazi Germany with her sister, met her husband-to-be.</p>

                    <p>Despite the financial burden of supporting Stern and his brother &ndash; also a UCLA alumnus &ndash; his parents, who had not received higher education, understood the importance of going to college, Stern said.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It was the motto &ndash; the driving force &ndash; in our family,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;(My parents) wanted their children to be educated, successful.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Stern said he couldn&rsquo;t have felt happier on the first day of college. UCLA had been his dream school ever since he saw a UCLA-Stanford football game when he was 10 years old. Captivated by the game, the blue and gold colors and the &ldquo;whole feeling of college,&rdquo; he had dreamed of attending UCLA for eight years.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It was just a sense of accomplishment &ndash; my first days of college life. Even today, when I walk on campus, it&rsquo;s still exciting for me,&rdquo; Stern said.</p>

                    VIGNETTE 3: STEVE
                    <p>Loeb grew up helping his father at the family drugstore, located half a mile from UCLA. He worked there part time &ndash; cleaning the floors, helping the customers and running errands for his father.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It was a chance to be together with my dad. I admired my dad, and I liked the work,&rdquo; Loeb said. &ldquo;I chose to follow in his footsteps.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Knowing that he had a six-year pharmacy program to complete, Loeb said he focused on fulfilling his degree requirements. Taking the psychology, political science or music classes that he was interested in meant he might not have been able to finish the program within six years, which would have put a hold on his dream of working alongside his father.</p>

                    <p>Loeb said he recalls taking one or two electives as a part of his general education requirements at UC Berkeley. One of them was a course about art history, which he enjoyed learning about because it was a field he had never explored.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;The science classes were prerequisites. That&rsquo;s how I equated them. But for liberal arts classes, they were something you were interested in taking,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p>But Loeb couldn&rsquo;t nurture his interests, because he had set goals after college.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;My priority was to finish grad school, and I had a girl I liked very much that I wanted to marry right after school,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                    <p>Ruthie Loeb was a business student at the University of Arizona while he was a pharmacy student at UC Berkeley, and they met at a Zeta Beta Tau party in 1960.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;I'm still with her now, 51 years later,&rdquo; Steve Loeb said.</p>

                    <p>He wanted to graduate from college as soon as possible partly because he felt the need to financially support himself and his future wife at the time, Loeb said. They tied the knot in 1964, right after he graduated from the USC School of Pharmacy. At 23 years old, Loeb was married and had a family that he was responsible for.</p>

                    <p>Loeb began working at his father&rsquo;s drugstore after graduating and eventually took over the place, expanding the family business until 2004, when he retired and entered the &ldquo;honeymoon of (his) life.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It gives you a chance to do whatever you want to do,&rdquo; Loeb said.</p>

                    <p>When he&rsquo;s not taking his wife out on dates, playing with his five grandchildren or keeping himself busy in other ways, he&rsquo;s in class with Rosenblatt and Stern &ndash; the same spots, twice a week. </p>

        <p>A university campus is reality&rsquo;s own version of Neverland, in a sense.</p>

        <p>Visit a campus years from now, and it will remain a home away from home for kids in their late teens and early 20s.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;We consider this the fountain of youth, because nobody else gets old except for us. Everybody is 20 years old,&rdquo; Rosenblatt said.</p>

        <p>Many undergraduate students are still young and finding their commitment to learning, and the perspectives that senior scholars bring are valuable assets in a classroom, said Marina Belozerskaya, a lecturer in Renaissance art history.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I find that they add a dimension of age and experience to the classroom that increases the energy level of the class and the shared purpose of education,&rdquo; Belozerskaya added.</p>

        <p>Although the Senior Scholars Program urges its participants to refrain from sharing their personal beliefs in the classroom, Belozerskaya said she encourages them to take an active role in class and ask questions.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Chances are the rest of the class will benefit from the answer,&rdquo; she said.</p>

        <p>Learning among younger students is intellectually valuable for the three friends, but they said there&rsquo;s more to the experience of being a senior scholar than just sitting in a classroom.</p>

        <p>They go on group dates with their wives to Schoenberg Hall for concerts and performances as well as Melnitz Hall for its film screenings. For the three friends, the Senior Scholars Program isn&rsquo;t just about catching up on their liberal arts education &ndash; it&rsquo;s the opportunity to learn purely for the sake of learning with friends that makes the program so valuable, they said.</p>

        <p>Over the years that they have known each other through the program, the senior scholars have even created their own tradition.</p>

        <p>For the last five years, Loeb, Rosenblatt, Stern, Ross and other senior scholars have been going out for birthday lunches when a person from their group reaches an odd-numbered age.</p>

        <p>On Oct. 20, it was Loeb&rsquo;s turn.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t write that he&rsquo;s turning 75,&rdquo; Ross whispered jokingly.</p>

        <p>It was just the four of them, and a few others that they had met along their journey at UCLA and some meaty, savory goodness at Lenny&rsquo;s Deli on Westwood Boulevard.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;We have the knowledge, we have the experience and the classroom. And we have the opportunity to have a camaraderie among our fellow students, the seniors &ndash; together,&rdquo; Stern said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big package.&rdquo;</p>
